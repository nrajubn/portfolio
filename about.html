        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Raju; I'm pursuing a master's in applied computer science. I am in my third-semester; I have three years of experience as a systems engineer in cognizant India. I worked with nine members, where I lead the team for my last six months before coming to the USA.  I used to give my clients presentations about my project and coordinate with the team and clients for further requirements. I have attended weekly calls and daily standup calls to discuss the project progress.</p>
        <p>. I have moved to the USA in spring 2020. I have worked as a design assistant for applied computer science and worked as a graduate assistant in the last semester.  I am flexible, determined, disciplined, innovative, and a good listener. </p>
